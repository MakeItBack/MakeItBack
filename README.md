ðŸ‘‹ I've been busy teaching myself to be a web developer. **It's starting to get really fun!**<br>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making my sites look great on mobile
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Javascript
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something fun and worthwhile
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a dev job
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about learning to code ... or ultralight hiking gear, or woodworking
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once saw Oasis play in the back room of a pub
